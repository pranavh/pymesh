# pymesh
An experimental meshing tool for CFD written in Python

As I'm writing this, I'm teaching myself a bunch of things:
 - Writing well-structured Python code
    - (https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/)
 - Test-Driven Development
     - (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/)
    - (https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/)
 - Maintaining a regular commit history, and writing good commit messages (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
 - Reinforcing the qualities of a good mesh by writing a program that can generate one
 - CFD mesh formats, their pros and cons, and how to convert between formats

If you see something that can be improved, I'd love to hear about it.
